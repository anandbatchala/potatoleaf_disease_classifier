name: Potato Disease Classification Using CNN
description: |
  This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying potato leaf images into three categories: **Early Blight**, **Late Blight**, and **Healthy**. Achieved impressive performance with **98% validation accuracy** and **94% test accuracy**. The model is designed for real-time disease detection to support effective agricultural management.

  ## Technologies Used
  - **TensorFlow**: Framework for building and training the CNN model.
  - **Keras**: High-level API in TensorFlow for model development.
  - **Python**: Programming language used for implementation.
  - **NumPy & Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
  - **Matplotlib**: For visualizing training and validation metrics.
  - **PlantVillage Dataset**: Source of images for training and testing.
  - **Anaconda**: Environment management and package handling.
  - **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development and experimentation.

  ## Features
  - **Robust CNN Architecture**: Designed with multiple convolutional and pooling layers.
  - **Data Augmentation**: Includes random flips and rotations to enhance model generalization.
  - **Efficient Data Pipeline**: Optimized for preprocessing and augmenting images.
